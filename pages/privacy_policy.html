          <p>
           The responsible party in terms of data protection laws, in particular
            the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is:
             <br/>
            Marco Lenschau
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle mt-32">Your rights as a data subject</h2>
          <p>
            You can exercise the following rights at any time in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) using the contact details provided:            <br/>
            Information about your data stored by us and its processing (Art. 15 GDPR),
            Correction of inaccurate personal data (Art. 16 GDPR),
            Deletion of your data stored by us (Art. 17 GDPR),
            Restriction of data processing, if we are not yet permitted to delete your data due to legal obligations (Art. 18 GDPR),
            Objection to the processing of your data by us (Art. 21 GDPR) and
            Data portability, provided that you have consented to data processing or have concluded a contract with us (Art. 20 GDPR).
            If you have given us your consent, you can revoke it at any time with effect for the future.<br/>
            You can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority at any time, e.g. with the competent supervisory authority of the federal state in which you reside or with the authority responsible for us as the responsible body.<br/>
            A list of supervisory authorities (for the non-public sector) with addresses can be found at: https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Anschriften_Links/anschriften_links-node.html.

If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>

          <p> We reserve the right to amend this privacy policy so that it always complies with current legal requirements or to implement changes to our services in the privacy policy, e.g. when introducing new services. The new privacy policy will then apply to your next visit.</p>

          <p>We take appropriate measures to protect your data, but please note that no method of data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>
          <h2 class="subtitle mt-32">Provision mandatory or required</h2>
